       <p>Some additional information here:</p>
       <p><strong>History</strong>
You may not realize it, but you probably grew up with the British Shorthair. He is the clever feline of Puss in Boots and the grinning Cheshire Cat of Alice in Wonderland.</p>
       <p>The British Shorthair is native to England. With the rise of cat shows during the Victorian era, cat fanciers began to breed the cats to a particular standard and keep pedigrees for them. At the earliest cat shows, British Shorthairs were the only pedigreed cats exhibited. All others were simply described by coat type or color.</p>

      <p><strong>Size</strong>
Males weight 12 to 20 pounds, females 8 to 14 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>Personality</strong>
The British Shorthair is mellow and easygoing, making him an excellent family companion. He enjoys affection, but he’s not a “me, me, me” type of cat. Expect him to follow you around the house during the day, settling nearby wherever you stop.</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong>
Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Problems that have been seen in the Shorthair are gingivitis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, both of which can affect any breed.</p>
<p><strong>Coat Color And Grooming</strong>
With his short, thick coat, round head and cheeks, big round eyes, and rounded body, the British Shorthair resembles nothing so much as a cuddly teddy bear. The coat comes in just about any color or pattern you could wish for, including lilac, chocolate, black, white, pointed, tabby and many more. The best known color is blue (gray) and the cats are sometimes referred to as British Blues.</p>

<p>The shorthair does not reach full physical maturity until he is 3 to 5 years old.
