      <h3><mark>British Shorthair Cat</mark> has a quiet voice and is an undemanding companion.
While not overly affectionate, the British Shorthair tends to get along just fine with everyone. They’re mellow and will tolerate other pets, and even though they may not seek out snuggles at every opportunity, they’re happy to be scooped up for a good cuddle.</h3>

       <p>Some additional information here:</p>
       <p><strong>History:</strong>
You may not realize it, but you probably grew up with the British Shorthair. He is the clever feline of Puss in Boots and the grinning Cheshire Cat of Alice in Wonderland.</p>
       <p>The British Shorthair is native to England. With the rise of cat shows during the Victorian era, cat fanciers began to breed the cats to a particular standard and keep pedigrees for them. At the earliest cat shows, British Shorthairs were the only pedigreed cats exhibited. All others were simply described by coat type or color.</p>

      <p><strong>Size:</strong>
Males weight 12 to 20 pounds, females 8 to 14 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>Personality:</strong>
The British Shorthair is mellow and easygoing, making him an excellent family companion. He enjoys affection, but he’s not a “me, me, me” type of cat. Expect him to follow you around the house during the day, settling nearby wherever you stop.</p>
